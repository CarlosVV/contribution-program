# Fermat Contribution Program

We are running a contribution program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently contributions are paid in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

## Sign-up - License Agreement - (READ FIRST)
Anyone who adds value to the Project in any form needs to sign up a Contribution License Agreement as the first step to become part of the project. To do that, please follow the steps described [here](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/tree/master/license-agreements/README.md) 

Then, after signing up,  you can follow the procedure below.

## Casual Contributions

Reporting or fixing bugs sporadically is considered *casual contribution*. We have the intention to develp an specific program for this, but as Fermat is not released yet this has still not been set up.

## Regular Contributions

There are serveral *regular contributors* to the project. Regular contributions are made by individuals working in teams part-time or full-time for the project. Most of them developers but also, graphic designers, artists, academics, copywriters, etc.

### Developers

Developers are organized in teams and each one is classified according to their time working on the project, engagement, area of the system they are working at, if they are leading a team or not, etc. Based on those cathegories they receive a monthly amount of Fermat tokens.

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DEV TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/README-DEV-TEAMS.md)

### Designers

Designers are also organized in teams and have their own cathegorization scheme. 

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DESIGN TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat-graphic-design/blob/master/README-DESIGN-TEAMS.md)
