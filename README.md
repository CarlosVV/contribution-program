# Fermat Contribution Program

We are running a contribution program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently contributions are paid in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

## Casual Contributions

Reporting or fixing bugs sporadically are considered casual contribution. We have the intention to develp an specific program for this, but as Fermat is not released yet this has not been set up yet.

## Regular Contributions

There are serveral regular contributors to the project. Regular contributions are made by individuals working part-time of full-time for the project. Starting 2016 Fermat had 50+ full-time contributors, most of them developers but also, graphic designers, artists, academics, copywriters, etc.

### Developers

Developers are organized in teams and each one is classified according to their time working on the project,e engagement, area of the system they are working at, if they are leading or not a team, etc. Based on those cathegories the will receive a monthly amount in Fermat tokens.

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DEV TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/README-DEV-TEAMS.md)

### Designers

Designers are also organized in teams and have their own cathegorization scheme. 

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DESIGN TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat-graphic-design/blob/master/README-DESIGN-TEAMS.md)
