# Fermat Contribution Program

We are running a contribution program to complete the projected functionality as soon as possible. Currently contributions are paid in Fermat tokens. This is one of the ways we use to distribute ownership of the project with whoever adds value to it. 

## License Agreement (read this first)
Anyone who adds value to the Project in the form of a Contributor according to this Contribution Program, needs to sign up a Contribution License Agreement as the first step to become part of the project. To do that, you only need to do the following:
 
1. In this repo you will find the Contributor License Agreement template file that you need to sign up for the competition ([here](https://github.com/bitDubai/contribution-program/blob/master/Contributor-License-Agreement.md))
2. Copy all of it's content to the clipboard, and go to the folder "license-agreements", create a new file starting with your name and the name of the template file, paste the content of the clipboard there and save it.

##### Example: 

```shell
Juan-Perez-Contributor-License-Agreement.md
```

<br>
##### Be Aware! : 

| Note:        | By adding this file to this repo you are signing it with your github account and agreeing on the terms and conditions mentioned there.            |

##### After Signing: 

You are done! Now you are signed up and can choose your way to contribute.

## Casual Contributions

Reporting or fixing bugs sporadically is considered *casual contribution*. We have the intention to develp an specific program for this, but as Fermat is not released yet this has still not been set up.

## Regular Contributions

There are serveral *regular contributors* to the project. Regular contributions are made by individuals working part-time or full-time for the project. Starting 2016 Fermat had 50+ full-time contributors, most of them developers but also, graphic designers, artists, academics, copywriters, etc.

### Developers

Developers are organized in teams and each one is classified according to their time working on the project, engagement, area of the system they are working at, if they are leading a team or not, etc. Based on those cathegories they receive a monthly amount of Fermat tokens.

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DEV TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat/blob/master/README-DEV-TEAMS.md)

### Designers

Designers are also organized in teams and have their own cathegorization scheme. 

All the details regarding this can be read at the [README DESIGN TEAMS](https://github.com/bitDubai/fermat-graphic-design/blob/master/README-DESIGN-TEAMS.md)
